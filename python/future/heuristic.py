    """
    Groups a list of numbers into k groups using a greedy heuristic.

    The core logic aims to balance group sums by placing the largest numbers
    first into the group with the currently smallest sum. The final fitness
    of the resulting partition is calculated using the provided `fitness_func`.

    Args:
        numbers (list[float | int]): A list of numbers to be partitioned.
        k (int): The desired number of groups.
        fitness_func (callable): A function that accepts a list of groups
                                 (a list of lists) and returns a single
                                 numerical fitness score. A lower score
                                 is considered better.

    Returns:
        tuple[list[list], float]: A tuple containing:
            - The list of k groups representing the best-found partition.
            - The fitness score of that partition, as calculated by fitness_func.
